# Error

The error message you're seeing indicates that your local main branch is behind the remote main branch on GitHub. This means that there are changes in the remote repository that you don't have in your local repository, and Git is preventing you from pushing your changes to avoid overwriting those updates.

```
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:opendevbook/Fedora41.git
```



## Hereâ€™s how to resolve the issue:

Fetch the latest changes from the remote:

```
git fetch origin
```
Merge the remote changes into your local branch:

```
git merge origin/main
```

If there are merge conflicts, you'll need to resolve them. Git will guide you through that process.

After resolving any conflicts and committing the merge, you can push your changes:

```
git push origin main
```

Alternatively, if you want to incorporate the changes from the remote without creating a merge commit, you can use rebase instead of merge:

Fetch the latest changes:
```
git fetch origin
```
Rebase your local changes on top of the remote changes:

```
git rebase origin/main
```

If there are conflicts during the rebase, resolve them, and then continue the rebase with:

```
git rebase --continue
```
Once the rebase is complete, push your changes:

```
git push origin main
```
Choose the method that you prefer based on your workflow! If you're collaborating with others, it's often best to coordinate how you handle merges and rebases.
